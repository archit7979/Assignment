//To create the tables for the messages and likes, you can use the following SQL code://
CREATE TABLE messages (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  message TEXT NOT NULL,
  created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW()
);

CREATE TABLE likes (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  message_id INTEGER REFERENCES messages(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW()
);

//The messages table will store the message content and the time it was created. The likes table will store a reference to the message that was liked, as well as the time the like was created.

To create the trigger that will update the like count for a message, you can use the following SQL code://

CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION update_like_count()
RETURNS TRIGGER AS $$
BEGIN
  UPDATE messages
  SET like_count = (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM likes WHERE message_id = NEW.message_id)
  WHERE id = NEW.message_id;
  RETURN NEW;
END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;

CREATE TRIGGER update_like_count
AFTER INSERT OR DELETE ON likes
FOR EACH ROW EXECUTE PROCEDURE update_like_count();
